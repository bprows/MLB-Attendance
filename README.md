# MLB-Attendance
Final Project for a course on Regression. Predicting attendance at MLB Games (in a pre-pandemic world).

Models were fit to predict attendance at San Diego Padre's games and generalized to predict attendance for every game. 

This is a challenging problem since each stadium has it's own capacity. This was preliminary work just applying some concepts that were discussed in a course on regression. Further work would go toward idnentifying models that can account for the stadium capacity, whihc could be treated as a missing data problem. Other ideas include clustering teams before modeling to have models for certain types of teams.
